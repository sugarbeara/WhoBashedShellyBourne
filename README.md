Bash Scripting Project

This is old school project on bash.  
The purpose of this project is to educate new bash users on how to use simple bash commands with a game.
This game involves traversing and searching files and bash scripts to solve a mystery.  But be careful, there are red herrings in the little puzzles.  

This game is meant for a linux environment.  It is still playable in PowerShell but not everything works.
