Hi. I am Ruby Caret, Shelly was a friend of mine. I do not understand why I am a suspect, I would never hurt Shelly! I was there to help her with her new furniture. That set of chairs is known to difficult to put together and take apart. She seemed very excited to tell me something. Said her financial prospects were getting better and I thought I heard a folder be dropped but maybe one of the men there was a klutz. Please get justice for Shelly!
