Im John Vi. I guess I'm a suspect because I was at Ms. Bourne's house an hour or so before she was murdered. I was delivering some chairs to her because I work at IKEA and she ordered some chairs from there. The other two were there as well because of their own business. I think that I was the first to leave so I did not see anything. I am innocent!
