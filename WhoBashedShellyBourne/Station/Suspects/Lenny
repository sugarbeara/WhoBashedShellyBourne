Lenny Towers is my name. Shelly Bourne hired me as a financial advisor. That was my second meeting with her about her finances. What were her finances? No, I will not say, she may be dead but client's get their privacy. The man from IKEA was there delivering some chairs and a friend of hers was there too. The friend was seemed interested in getting financial advice too. I never saw the chair guy leave. I could not have possibly committed the crime!
